## Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use Amazon SageMaker to create an end-to-end machine learning workflow. We will walk you through the following steps:

1. Data Preparation: Preprocess and prepare the dataset for training the model.
2. Model Building: Define and build a machine learning model using SageMaker's built-in algorithms or custom code.
3. Model Training: Train the model on the prepared data using SageMaker training instances.
4. Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model to a SageMaker endpoint for real-time inference.

## Prerequisites

Before you proceed with the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. An AWS account: You need an active AWS account to access the SageMaker service.
2. AWS CLI (optional but recommended): It's useful to have the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) installed and configured with your AWS credentials.

## Getting Started

To get started with the tutorial, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/build-train-deploy-machine-learning-model-sagemaker.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python dependencies:

   ```
   cd build-train-deploy-machine-learning-model-sagemaker
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your AWS credentials (if not done already). You can configure AWS CLI or set environment variables.

4. Follow the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to go through the step-by-step tutorial.
